to assign the return value of Commands with `const`, `let`, or `var`.

[aliases and closures to access and store](/guides/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases)
what Commands yield you.

:::

Many first time users look at Cypress code and think it runs synchronously.

We see new users commonly write code that looks like this:

```js
// DONT DO THIS. IT DOES NOT WORK
// THE WAY YOU THINK IT DOES.
const a = cy.get('a')

cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')

// nope, fails
a.first().click()

// Instead, do this.
cy.get('a').as('links')
cy.get('@links').first().click()
```

<strong>Did you know?</strong>

You rarely have to ever use `const`, `let`, or `var` in Cypress. If you're using
them, you will want to do some refactoring.

:::

If you are new to Cypress and wanting to better understand how Commands work -
[please read our Introduction to Cypress guide](/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Chains-of-Commands).

If you're familiar with Cypress commands already, but find yourself using
`const`, `let`, or `var` then you're typically trying to do one of two things:

- You're trying to **store and compare** values such as **text**, **classes**,
  **attributes**.
- You're trying to share **values** between tests and hooks like `before` and
  `beforeEach`.

For working with either of these patterns, please read our
[Variables and Aliases guide](/guides/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases).
