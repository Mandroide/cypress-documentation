As your test suite grows and takes longer to run, you may find yourself hitting
performance bottlenecks on your CI system. We recommend integrating your source
control system with your test suite such that merges are blocked until all your
Cypress tests have passed. The downside of this is that longer test execution
times slow the velocity at which branches may be merged and features may be
shipped. This issue is compounded further if you have dependent chains of
branches waiting to be merged.

One solution to this problem is
[Smart Orchestration with Cypress Cloud](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration).
Using a combination of [parallelization](/guides/guides/parallelization),
[load balancing](/guides/guides/parallelization#Balance-strategy),
[Auto Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Auto-Cancellation), and
[Spec Prioritization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration#Spec-Prioritization),
Smart Orchestration maximizes your available compute resources & minimizes
waste.
