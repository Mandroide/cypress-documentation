[cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) without setting a `baseUrl`.

:::tip

&#8239;<Icon name="check-circle" color="green" /> **Best Practice:** Set a
`baseUrl` in your [Cypress configuration](/guides/references/configuration).

:::

By adding a [baseUrl](/guides/references/configuration#Global) in your
configuration Cypress will attempt to prefix the `baseUrl` any URL provided to
commands like [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit) and
[cy.request()](/api/commands/request) that are not fully qualified domain name
(FQDN) URLs.

This allows you to omit hard-coding fully qualified domain name (FQDN) URLs in
commands. For example,

```javascript
cy.visit('http://localhost:8080/index.html')
```

can be shortened to

```javascript
cy.visit('index.html')
```

Not only does this create tests that can easily switch between domains, i.e.
running a dev server on `http://localhost:8080` vs a deployed production server
domain, but adding a `baseUrl` can also save some time during the initial
startup of your Cypress tests.

When you start running your tests, Cypress does not know the url of the app you
plan to test. So, Cypress initially opens on `https://localhost` + a random
port.

### Without `baseUrl` set, Cypress loads main window in `localhost` + random port

<DocsImage

  alt="Url address shows localhost:53927/__/#tests/integration/organizations/list_spec.coffee"
/>

As soon as it encounters a [cy.visit()](/api/commands/visit), Cypress then
switches to the url of the main window to the url specified in your visit. This
can result in a 'flash' or 'reload' when your tests first start.

By setting the `baseUrl`, you can avoid this reload altogether. Cypress will
load the main window in the `baseUrl` you specified as soon as your tests start.

### Cypress configuration file

:::cypress-config-example

```ts
{
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8484',
  },
}
```

### With `baseUrl` set, Cypress loads main window in `baseUrl`

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/references/cypress-loads-window-in-base-url-localhost.png"
  alt="Url address bar shows localhost:8484/__tests/integration/organizations/list_spec.coffee"
/>

Having a `baseUrl` set gives you the added bonus of seeing an error if your
server is not running during `cypress open` at the specified `baseUrl`.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/references/cypress-ensures-baseUrl-server-is-running.png"
  alt="Cypress Launchpad with warning about how Cypress could not verify server set as the baseUrl is running"
/>

We also display an error if your server is not running at the specified
`baseUrl` during `cypress run` after several retries.

  alt="The terminal warns and retries when the url at your baseUrl is not running"
/>
