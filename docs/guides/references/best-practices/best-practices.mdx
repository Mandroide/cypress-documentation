### <Icon name="graduation-cap" /> Real World Practices

The Cypress team maintains the
&nbsp;<Icon name="github" inline="true" contentType="rwa" />, a full stack
example application that demonstrates **best practices and scalable strategies
with Cypress in practical and realistic scenarios**.

The RWA achieves full [code-coverage](/guides/tooling/code-coverage) with
end-to-end tests
[across multiple browsers](/guides/guides/cross-browser-testing) and
[device sizes](/api/commands/viewport), but also includes
[visual regression tests](/guides/tooling/visual-testing), API tests, unit
tests, and runs them all in an
[efficient CI pipeline](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt).

The app is bundled with everything you need,
[just clone the repository](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)
and start testing.
